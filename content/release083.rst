I'm happy to announce the release of version 0.8.3. This release includes many fixes and changes, in particular the addition of the debugger front-end as default now that Csound 6.03 has been released which includes debugging capabilites.

Other changes include:

	- Added hover window in parameter mode showing opcode and parameter details
	- Removed status bar as it no longer plays an important role
	- Fixed graph displays
	- ScratchPad renamed to Codepad and added a selector to specify whether to evaluate code as Csound code or Python code.
	- Better auto-completion, parameter mode and tab behavior



You can get the source and pre-built binaries for OS X in the `SourceForge 0.8.3 files page <https://sourceforge.net/projects/qutecsound/files/CsoundQt/0.8.3/>`_.
