CsoundQt has a new virtual MIDI keyboard. It was long overdue, as the FLTK MIDI keyboard provided by Csound had constant issues because FLTK was clashing with Qt. The keyboard is written using QML, and because of this lays the basis for adding a Virtual Keyboard widget that you could add to the widget panel. I've also been dreaming about a generic QML widget for the widget panel after this...
