I have added MIDI learn functionality to CsoundQt. To use it:

1. open the MIDI learn window from the view menu
2. Select a widget (You need to be in Edit mode in the widget panel)
3. Move your MIDI controller
4. Enjoy

That should be it. As usual, please report any issues or suggestions on the mailing list or the tracker.

PS. Issues with Csound's internal MIDI modules should now be fixed.
